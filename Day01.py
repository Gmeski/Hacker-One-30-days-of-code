""" Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d , s and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
Use the + operator to perform the following operations: 
Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. """

i  = 3
d  = 2.0
s  = "I am "

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
k = int(input())
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
p = float(input())
# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
m = str(input())
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(k + i)
print(p + d)
print(s + m)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
